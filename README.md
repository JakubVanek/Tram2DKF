A set of utilities for testing tram localization algorithms.

The package can be roughly split in three parts:

* Framework for defining linear and nonlinear state space models
* Implementation of Kalman filters:
  * Linear Kalman filter
  * Extended Kalman filter
  * Iterated Extended Kalman filter
* Generator of tram trajectories based on simple track geometry description
